# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in
surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children,
and the upper-class. The task of this project is to predict whether a given passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic based on various attributes including age, gender, family size, ticket, the fare they paid, and other information using tools of machine learning. Solutions are evaluated by comparing the percentage of correct answers on a test dataset.
